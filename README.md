# Ray-Tracer

This was a school project for my CS455 Computer Graphics course. It is a fully functioning ray tracer that generates ppm files. The scenes that are rendered are currently hard coded in the main file and only need to be uncommented to use. Simple run the make file located in the Raytracer folder and the code with generate the image.

Things I learned:
  * Linear algebra applications in computer graphics
  * Phong model for lighting and shading
  * Ray-intersect algorithms for spheres and polygons
  * C++ orginization
  * Lots of debuging
